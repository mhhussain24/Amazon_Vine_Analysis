# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview 
The purpose of this project is analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

## Results
-There were 1080 Vine reviews and 49659 non vine reviews
-There were 454 Vine 5 star reviews and 23034 non vine member 5 star reviews.
-42% of Vine reviews were 5 stars and 46.4 percent of non vine reviews were 5 star.

## Summary
Vine members did not show positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program, based on the results. This can be concluded because Vine members gave 10% lss 5-star ratings than Non-Vine members. One thing we could do with this dataset to support this is to look at is as a whole instead of filtering it down to percentages.
